## Can I Leave Melbourne?

### A really dumb creation by [Terence Huynh](https://terencehuynh.com) because of Lockdown 2.0

The name is pretty self-explanatory. But hey, if you wanted to check out the source code of
the dumb creation I made, I guess here you go.

#### What this site is not:

- **Official government advice**

  Visit the [Department of Health and Human Services](https://www.dhhs.vic.gov.au/coronavirus) for the latest
  information about COVID-19 in Victoria.

- **Legal advice.**

  I am not a layer. If you find yourself in trouble, this website is not the same as asking a lawyer or
  getting legal advice from legal aid. This is just a dumb website.

#### Getting Started
